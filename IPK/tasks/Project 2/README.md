Students of 2BIT (i.e., students in the second year of the BIT bachelor's program) can choose from _any non-ALPHA_ variant.

> <span style="color:red">Students of 3BIT (i.e., all non-2BIT students such as students of 3rd and later years) can register <i>only for the ALPHA or IOTA</i> variant!
Submissions of students not following this restriction <b>will not be evaluated</b>!
</span>
The reason behind this restriction is that no student of the IPK course should have the chance to repeat the same project twice.
